# python-challenge

This is a challenge that teach me how to read csv files in python. 
In particular, the focus is on aggregations, and calculations based on columns. 

The skills that I used are:
  1) Loops to iterate through rows
  2) storing rows into list, and recalling list functions such as sum(list_)
  3) storing results into dictionaries for easy recall
  4) lookup index in list based on min, and max
